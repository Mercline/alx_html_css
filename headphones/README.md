# Holberton School Headphone Company

Welcome to the Holberton School Headphone Company project! This repository contains the code and resources for a responsive web application designed to showcase our headphone products effectively.

## Figma Design

You can view the design prototype on Figma: [Holberton School - Headphone Company](https://www.figma.com/file/TwFqqWGYvNYvxZxhdWXv4H/Holberton-School---Headphone-company).

## Important Notes with Figma

- If your computer doesnâ€™t have the fonts used, you can find them here:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
